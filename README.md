This is a detailed analysis of a housing data set. I attempt to create a model that can predict housing prices
RESEARCH PROBLEM
As a Data Scientist, you work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. You have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

a)Understanding context
Real estate is a lucrative business because there is a high demand for good housing among people of a given area. For a real estate company, there is a need take a data driven approach; in order to analyse the factors that affect the prices of houses.

b)Specifying the question
In this analysis, I will explore and analyse the data provided and come up with a model to accurately predict the prices of houses.

c)Defining the metric of Success
Success will be achieved when I understand the data, identify the best model to predict price where accuracy is highest and error, lowest.

d)Experimental design
